#include <iostream>
//Write the code for the counterType class. Your solution must include:
//A header file (counterType.h)
//A class implementation file (counterType.cpp), and
//A file with the main function that tests your class.
//The header file should contain the preconditions and postconditions for each of the public member functions as comments before the prototype.
 
//The test program should show:
//The value of a counterType object declared with the default constructor (no parameters).
//The value of a counterType object declared with a user-supplied parameter.
//The result of an increment operation.
//The result of a decrement operation.
//The result of a reset operation.
//The result of attempting a decrement operation after the reset operation.
//The result of setting the counter object to a value of 10.
